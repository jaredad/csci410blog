This week I have downloaded and installed Linux on my personal laptop. I can boot either Linux or Windows whenever I need to. I have also downloaded Neuron onto my computer in Linux. It was a difficult process because downloading packages is different in Linux, use of the terminal is required to get anything working. I had to fix some broken packages, but I was able to begin using Neuron. I have just followed the first few steps from [this tutorial](http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/index.html) created by MIT. Essentially, I have begun creating a code soma with some attributes, but not much beyond that and not to the point of visual representation or simulation (code snippets of these can be found below). To bridge my knowledge gap, I am taking up the strategy of doing research on the different variable related to neurons while I start these tutorials. That way I can better understand what I am creating, without having to have the entire textbook read before I begin coding. I have spoken with Dr. Murray and we will meet up the Friday after fall break to tackle the cluster.
