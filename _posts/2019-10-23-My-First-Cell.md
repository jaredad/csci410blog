This week I started reading the NEURON book, which was created for the purpose of walking users through the basics of how to use NEURON. The first example shows you how to create a minimal pyramidal neuron (using just NEURON gui) with simple anatomy and characteristics. The cell is composed of four parts:
* Soma - the bulbous, non-process portion of a neuron
* Axon - a long threadlike part of a nerve cell along which impulses are conducted from the cell body to other cells
* Apical - a dendrite that emerges from the apex of a pyramidal cell
* Basilar - a dendrite that emerges from the base of a pyramidal cell that receives information from nearby neurons and passes it to the soma

Next, I will learn how to actually use this model I've created to run a simple experiment. Below is an image of the model.
