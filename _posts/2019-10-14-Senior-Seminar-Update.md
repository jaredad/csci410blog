This week I have downloaded and installed Linux on my personal laptop. I can boot either Linux or Windows whenever I need to. I have also downloaded Neuron onto my computer in Linux. It was a difficult process because downloading packages is different in Linux, use of the terminal is required to get anything working. I had to fix some broken packages, but I was able to begin using Neuron. I have just followed the first few steps from this MIT tutorial. Essentially, I have begun creating a code soma with some attributes, but not much beyond that and not to the point of visual representation. To bridge my knowledge gap, I am taking up the strategy of doing research on the different variable related to neurons while I start these tutorials. That way I can better understand what I am creating, without having to have the entire textbook read before I begin coding. I have spoken with Dr. Murray and we will meet up after fall break to tackle the cluster.
